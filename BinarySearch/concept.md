3 Parts of a Successful Binary Search

Binary Search is generally composed of 3 main sections:

1. Pre-processing - Sort if collection is unsorted.  

2. Binary Search - Using a loop or recursion to divide search space in half after each comparison.  

3. Post-processing - Determine viable candidates in the remaining space.
